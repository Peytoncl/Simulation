# About

This is a simulation of organisms made in OpenGL and C. I'm trying to go as complex as I can while still learning. I will document all of my findings and the things I add in detail.

# Documentation

I will be documenting my findings and progress and how things work on the Trello, you can find it [here](https://trello.com/b/c9LJCuyt/simulation)
